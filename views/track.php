          <p>This whole chapter was began from kartu Prakerja, held by
            Indonesian Government. Alhamdulillah i finally join Prakerja
            at 13<sup>rd</sup> phase.<br>
            Kartu Prakerja has brought me to know about Skilvul.
            I've learn alot from skilvul. I never knew before that learning to code
            doesnt always mean that you have to install every software you need
            on your own desktop.
            Yep, i was graduated from Computer Engineering many years ago. All i
            know that programming based softwares are expensive, and demand alot
            of spaces within storage more over it require higher computer spec.
            Silly me right. Now i know there are a bunch of websites offering
            coding skills directly from their websites. All you need is just
            a stable internet and a browser. Tadaaa you can test your skill
            immediately.<br>
            From Skilvul i join some of their free webinar. yes its free but the
            result was not tuppenny at all. Now i can say that building a web
            sites within a day...... yes thats super possible.
            Skilvul Webinar with Scarletta Yapfrine-Product Engineer-Gojek taught
            me to build a website in just few hours like <a

          <h4>Aleisha Fiona-Leadership Development Gojek, Founder Relearn Indonesia</h4>
          <h4>Getting ahead by learning to unlearn and relearn</h4>
          <p>Live is a never ending learning journey, how ever for those who was
            born around 80's to 90's like me maybe ever had some confusing
            moment when your knowledge before is suddently became
            not valid and or not relevant anymore. Some shocking moment of truth has
            sometimes driven me to become skeptical against knowledges.
            Such as, during my childhood every teachers in every schools and
            all literature you can find will told you that Pluto is the smallest
            planet in Milkyway Galaxy and that earth is round. All of by suddent
            by the end of twenty first centuries at around 2006, the world of
            astronomical has officially pronounce that Pluto is now become dwarf
            planet, while earth is round or flat is still debatable till now.
            A few years before that, the history of G30S PKI also becoming
            controversial. Darwinism doctrine proven to be totally mistake.
            All those doctrine that you received since your childhood
            suddently become nothing and forgetable is something that your brain
            may not easily acceptable.
            Well this whole learning process is related to what is explained by
            Ms. Aleisha Fiona (also well known as Ms. Ale). <br>
            In order to thrive this millenium era an the future industries we
            need to instill a growth mindset by keep learn, unlearn and relearn
            about some knowledge. There are
            so many changes in the past which is not reliable anylongger. <br>
            Today we need to Built following Character & soft skills:
            <ul>
              <li>Flexibility and adaptability</li>
              <li>Critical & Creative thinking</li>
              <li>Communication skills</li>
              <li>Emotional Intelligence</li>
              <li>Digital or tech literacy</li>
              <li>keep your sense of couriousity high by Googling</li>
            </ul>
            In order to prepare our self to be acceptable to absorb new knowledges
            we need to unlearn our previous knowledge. Unlearning process allows
            you to discard and validate the relevance of your past knowledge.
            Then you need to reconnect your initial knowledge by relearning new
            knowledges to get it more solid and relevant. It is important to keep
            our mind open to perception and possibilities.
            at the end we get into a summary that each changes may derrive our
            experiences now and then to keep our growth.

          <h4>Kevin Aluwi - Co-Founder and CEO Gojek</h4>
          <h4>What to Prepare to be a Change Maker</h4>
          <p>
            Gojek was established as Technology Industries Corporate by
             Kevin Aluwi and his colleague Nadine during their partnership on another
             e-commerce Industries. at the beginning Gojek was only some kind of
             side business for its Co-Founders. By 2014 Gojek has transform into
             what its become today.<br>
             Believe it or not The key of Gojek success today is the fact that
             most "Ojek" driver are reliable, hard worker, and
             able to give their best services which is totally against negative
             stigma given by common society back then. <br>
             to build a business you need to believe into it and Every obstacle
             that stand before it should be handled with full of
             confidence that it is solve able. <br>
            Being a character who is never feel complacent enough for an
            achievement, has derive Kevin to keep looking forward to gain what
            to do or what to develop next.
            Gojek has developed to become part of common daily life nowadays this
            condition has impress Kevin. <br>
            Technical Industries in Indonesia are growing so rapidly, unfortunately
            this rapid growth are not even with the speed of talents ability to
            improve their skill from low and intermediate level to higher
            senior/ leadership level.
            Being persistent especially when you starting up or buiding something
            new is incredibly important. You will have to face many sceptical
            point of view from others.
